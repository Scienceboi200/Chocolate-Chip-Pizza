Preheat oven to 500F (260C) and line a pizza pan with parchment paper. Set aside.
In a large bowl, combine flour, yeast, and salt and stir well.
Add water and stir until ingredients are mostly combined. Use your hands to continue to combine until the dough is cohesive enough to form a ball.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes (until elastic). If needed, add additional flour 1 Tablespoon at a time if dough is too sticky and sticks stubbornly to your hands.
Roll dough out into a 12” circle and transfer to prepared pizza pan. Pinch edges or gently fold over to form a crust.
Prepare your cream cheese “sauce” by cutting your cream cheese into 8 pieces and place in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat for 10 second intervals, stirring between each, until cream cheese is easy to stir.
Add sugar and vanilla extract, stir well.
Spread cream cheese “sauce” evenly over pizza dough.
Sprinkle chocolate chips evenly overtop and press/spread into the “sauce”. Prepare your streusel.
Streusel
Add vanilla extract to melted butter, stir, and set aside.
In a separate bowl, use a fork to mix together flour and sugars.
Add butter mixture and use a fork to combine until mixture resembles coarse crumbles.
Sprinkle evenly over pizza
Bake pizza in 500F (260C) oven for 7 minutes or until streusel turns a golden brown.
Remove from oven, allow to cool for several minutes, then slice and serve.
